# React Native Pokedex App

I created this app as a simple demo of [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).
This repository has four tags that work as steps in a tutorial.  You can see the
tags by running `git tags` and you can see the code at each step by running
`git checkout <tagname>`.

- Step 0 is an empty React Native app freshly generated by the CLI.
- Step 1 is a single page with a text input, switch, and slider.  This
  demonstrates that React Native renders true native components that match the
  look and feel of their respective platforms.
- Step 2 changes the single page of the app to display a list view of Pokemon.
  The Pokemon data is copied from the [PokeAPI](http://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/).
- Step 3 adds navigation by allowing a user to press a row in the list view and
  open a detail page.  It also adds a persistent header to each page of the app.

After following all these steps you can get a good feel for how a React Native
app works.  It barely scratches the surface of React Native's capabilities, but
still serves as a good introduction.
